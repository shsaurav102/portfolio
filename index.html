    <p>A game where the user needs to open the doors without running into the chore robot. If the user manages to open all the doors by avoiding the robot the user wins, else he loses. Made this interactive game by manipulating a web page structure by leveraging the Document Object Model interface in JavaScript. Utilized event and event handlers along with the selectors to improve the user experience.
